# Marvel Assemble

Marvel Assemble is a full-stack MERN app that allows a user to search for a Marvel hero or villain through Marvel's API. The user can then add a hero or villain to a team and save the team for their "Dream Team" super hero squad.

I was inspired to make this app becuse I'm a huge comic nerd who has spent hours of his life basically doing this in his head without an app.

## Getting Started
 [Click Here](https://marvel-assemble.herokuapp.com/) to see the deployed app. You can sign in to save your team or simply start searching and create a team on the fly. Please note you will only be able to save your team if you're logged in.
