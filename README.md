# Marvel Assemble

Marvel Assemble is a full-stack MERN app that allows a user to search for a Marvel hero through Marvel's API.

I was inspired to make this app becuse I'm a huge comic nerd who has spent hours of his life basically doing this in his head without an app.

## Getting Started
 [Click Here](https://marvel-assemble.herokuapp.com/) to see the deployed app. You can sign up, log in and log out. You can also utilize the search functionality to call up the hero of your choice.
